This code defines a simple interactive web application that allows users to explore cat breed data retrieved from TheCatAPI.
Upon loading, it fetches a list of cat breeds and provides several buttons for the user to view or filter information such as breed names, health issues, weight in imperial or metric units, intelligence and affection levels, and average intelligence scores. 
The interface is built using HTML and styled with CSS, while all data handling and user interaction are managed through JavaScript. 
Results are displayed dynamically within a dedicated results box on the page.
I have taken some help from chatgpt.
